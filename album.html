He might got the biggest ca-a-ar
Don't mean he can drive me wild
Or he can go for miles
Said he got a lot of ca-a-ash
Darling, he can't buy my love
It's you I'm dreaming of
They try to romance me, but you got that nasty
And that's what I want (that's what I want)
So baby, baby
Come and save me
Don't need those other numbers
When I got my number one
